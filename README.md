# American-Express-Default-Prediction
This project applies machine learning to predict credit card default risk using anonymized customer profile and behavioral time-series data provided by American Express. The goal is to engineer a model that can outperform existing production models and improve risk management in consumer lending.

## Objective
Build a robust classification model to:

Predict whether a customer will default on their credit card.
Handle challenges such as high cardinality, missing values, and temporal patterns.
Improve customer experience and support better lending decisions.

## Approach

Modeling Technique: Time-series classification using XGBoost.
Feature Engineering: Extensive exploration of behavioral and profile features.
Data Challenges: Addressed missing values and high-cardinality features using model-native imputation and custom preprocessing strategies.

## Impact
A successful model could:

## Enhance credit risk assessment.
Improve approval processes for cardholders.
Potentially challenge the current production model used by American Express.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
XGBoost
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
